# google-homepage

### I made a google

This is my absolute first web and/or programming project outside of tutorials. It was an assignment from The Odin Project to make a stylistic copy of Google's homepage with HTML and CSS. It looked great on my browser at full size, but some of it got a bit crazy when I resized the page. All in all this project could be redone way more efficiently and responsively but it shows that I can style a variety elements on a web page. 

### More details and reflections

#### Main issues 

The icons and buttons in and around the search bar went completely out of place when resizing the viewport. I kept playing with them to make them look right and little did I know I was only perfecting them on a particular browser size. The assignment didn’t mention media queries, flex box, browser behavior or sizing all of which I barely understood at the time. After some failed attempts to resolve these issues, I moved on. 

#### What I did well 

I got the positioning of elements very close on my screen size. I also achieved some good looking color styles and hover attributes for buttons and links. I tried to copy sizes, colors and subtle changes seen on the google website and got pretty close with all the details. 

#### My slightly different approach

The assignment suggested using `<ul>` tags for the header and footer. I didn’t like how they positioned so I tried using grids to arrange everything. I also thought I was doing something wrong when the right justified links appeared in reverse order so grid design just seemed to give me more control. In hindsight flex box would have been even better but the recommended approach would have been the easiest.
